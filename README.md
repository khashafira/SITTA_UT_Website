# SITTA_UT_Website

SITTA (Sistem Informasi Tugas dan Transaksi Akademik) is a web-based learning material management system developed as a university project at Universitas Terbuka.  
This project aims to simplify and digitalize the process of managing, tracking, and viewing the stock and delivery of learning materials for students and administrators.

---

## 🌐 Project Overview
This website was created as part of an academic assignment.  
It allows **two main roles**:  
- **Administrator** – can manage (add/delete) learning material data.  
- **Student** – can order materials, view billing history, and track delivery.

The system runs fully on the browser using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with data stored in **localStorage**, meaning it works offline without a backend server.
